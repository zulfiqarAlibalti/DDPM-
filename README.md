## Introduction

Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPM) are a class of generative models that have shown great promise in generating high-quality images. This project focuses on applying DDPM to biomedical imaging, aiming to enhance image quality and provide better diagnostic tools.

## Features

- **High-Quality Image Generation**: Generate high-resolution biomedical images.
- **Noise Reduction**: Effectively reduce noise in medical images.
- **Customizable Parameters**: Fine-tune the model parameters for specific imaging tasks.

## Installation

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/biomedical-imaging-ddpm.git
    cd biomedical-imaging-ddpm
    ```

2. **Create a virtual environment**:
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3. **Install the required dependencies**:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

To run the DDPM model on your biomedical images, follow these steps:

1. **Prepare your dataset**: Ensure your biomedical images are in the `data/` directory.

2. **Train the model**:
    ```bash
    python train.py --config configs/default.yaml
    ```

3. **Generate images**:
    ```bash
    python generate.py --model checkpoints/model.pth --output results/
    ```

4. **Evaluate the results**: Check the generated images in the `results/` directory.
